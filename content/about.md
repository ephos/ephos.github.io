## About Me

Heyo! Bobby here!  

Welcome to my space for jotting down this, that, etcetera and something or other!  
If you're here, I hope you find something useful in your journey.  

I have no place for big egos or high horses.  
Technology is a gift, as is learning it.  
Everyone is somewhere in their journey and none of us have reached the end.
Be curious.

About me:

- I talk too much about using Arch _(btw)_.
- I will also talk way too much about Neovim and Vim motions.
- `pwsh` is my default shell because I just love an object pipeline.
  * _)If you have beef with that see the section above!)_
- I still love byte-streaming shells like `bash` and `zsh`!
  * _(When you need speed or ubiquity, you can't the classics)_
- I love solving problems and customizing every little aspect of things. 
  * _(hence Arch with Hyprland and Neovim)_
- I have the attention span of a housefly sometimes.
  * _(But that power is the reason why I have dabbled in to many different tech stacks and languages!)_

Zen of learning:

```text
To the novice, mountains are mountains and waters are waters;
To the intermediate student mountains are no longer mountains, and waters are no longer waters;
To the master, mountains are once again mountains and waters are once again waters.
```

- Bobby
