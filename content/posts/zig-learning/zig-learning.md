## Learning Zig

![zig](/posts/zig-learning/zig.svg)

I'm starting my adventure into the world of Zig!  

Why? .. Well if I am being honest my reasons are probably a bit odd/personal.  
I've always wanted to learn a low level language and I like a good challenge.  
I have programmed with Go here and there for various tools but I've always found it...  
   ...Boring to read and write.  
In my research I like Zig's approach, mission, and various non-toxic communities.

Don't get me wrong, I love Go but I wanted something a bit more exciting.
Rust was certainly a brief consideration, but the more I heard about Zig, the more excited I was for it.

## My Starting Point for Zig

Most of my background is with interpreted scripting languages.  
As mentioned, I have written a fair amount of Go and C# but my core is a scripting/tool making person.

With that said, I try to be honest about knowing what I don't know. 

Concepts I feel good about:

- Data Types
- Functions/Methods
- Classes
- Control Flow
- Using External Libraries / Dependencies
- Interpreted vs. Compiled vs. Intermediate (C# (CIL/CLR) / Java (JVM))

Where I am a dummy:

- Zig Syntax
- Zig's Build System
- Memory Management
- Lower level patterns
- Algorithms and when to use the right one
- I could be better with design patterns

I'm sure there are some I am missing in both categories.  
I've been spoiled by the abstractions of higher level languages for too long!  
**Time to try and end that!**


Even on the concepts I know, I tend to feel comfortable in knowing what I don't know.  
My intent is to stay humble as I understand the danger of _"knowing enough to be dangerous"_...  

## The Planned Methodology

1. Starting from the beginning, even on refreshing of concepts I know from other languages
2. Ziglings, Ziglings, and more Ziglings
3. 1-2 Hours a day of Zig time
4. Minimal use of LLMs _(They can guide me but I do not want direct answers)_
5. Build simple tools (CLI initially) and expand from there
6. Eventually build a very minimal game/game engine to better understand game engines.

## Extra's

I **_may_** from time to time stream the chaos of this adventure on Twitch.
I would like to at a minimum curate some YouTube content if it helps others.
