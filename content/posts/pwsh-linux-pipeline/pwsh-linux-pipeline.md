## The Question

This is one that's gotten a confused look from friend, colleague, and stranger alike.  

It tends to go something like this:

> "_You run Arch Linux but use PowerShell as your default shell???_

## History

I love Linux, and _yes_ I am just going to call it 'Linux' and not 'GNU/Linux' or some variant of that so please don't throw things at me!
My fascination began in my early college days.  I was enamoured by the glory of enabling _'wobbly windows'_ within KDE in the mid 2000's.  
it was absolutely exhilarating!  

Fast forward and I administered Linux systems (and Windows systems) for work.  
I would still occasionally dabble with Linux at home, but wasn't ready to make the switch.

In mid 2018 I bought a Lenovo T480 laptop and installed Arch Linux and that was my first full Linux install.

It has some hardware issues and lives in my workshop but I dusted it off to bring you proof.  I also hadn't updated it in like... 1.5 years.  

Sooooo I had to do a `pacman-key --refresh-keys`, comment out the old _community_ repo, and approve about 100 package replacements...  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...883 package updates later!

Holy nostalgia seeing my old i3 theme and settings!

Later in 2019 I built a new desktop and installed Arch on that and have run Linux full time ever since.
_thank goodness for Steam and Proton!!!!!!!_

## PowerShell

You saw the `pacstrap` and I installed `zsh`, so why PowerShell???

It's simple, objects.  I just love working with objects.  

Are objects faster? No, not really.
Are objects easier? Not necessarily, probably depends on what you're most comfortable with.
