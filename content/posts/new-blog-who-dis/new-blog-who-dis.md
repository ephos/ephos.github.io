## Welcome to the Overhaul!

### Why?...

1. A little bit of boredom.
2. A little bit of rebranding.
3. I was a bit over Jekyll.
4. I wanted a theme that was very easy to customize and extend...

...Thanks to [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) as my theme base, it's just HTML and CSS, no more JS!

**LONG LIVE!**

What's changing?

- More generalized coding and tech content.
  * New language content
  * New concepts like game engine building
  * More Linux content
  * More Neovim content

Q: _"Oh no! Is the PowerShell content done and over?"_  
A: Nope, not entirely, there may be a bit less of it and it might be more Linux specific.

Q: _Will the old posts and PowerShell content migrate?_  
A: YES! (Some of it).  I'm pulling in the pages Google Analytics said got hit the most as well as my favs.

### Onto the Next Chapter!

_Annnnnnnd_ with that, let's light this candle!
