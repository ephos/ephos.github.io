### Overview

I am writing this here because with the uncertainty of the future of Reddit I still wanted this information locatable if the Reddit post disappears.
I built a new PC in the summer of 2022 and part of it included the [Corsair H100i Elite Capellix Liquid CPU Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G1NSG7F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
I had good luck with my prior Corsair cooler and figured why not?

Hardware items in play:

- **Cooler:** Corsair iCUE H100i Elite Capellix Liquid CPU Cooler
- **Board:** ASUS Prime X570-Pro
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X

### The Issue

I ended up with the newer AM4 mounting bracket which had 4 standoffs instead of the prior 2 hooks/thumbscrew configuration.
I went to assemble the cooler mounting hardware to the board and I noticed there was a lot of play with the back plate.

### Troubleshooting

Of course I re-read the Corsair instructions and validated all the steps were followed correctly, still had a lot of wiggle.
I also found a video on the 'Corsair Lab' YouTube channel which walked through the process but frustratingly it made no mention of any wiggle.

- Video here if interested: [How to Install CORSAIR iCUE RGB ELITE Liquid CPU Cooler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9swpPo-ey0w&t=85s).

I searched various materials but I only continued to find older references to a different H100i mounting bracket or unresolved questions similar to mine.

I eventually posted it on the "/r/Corsair" subreddit and had the answer confirmed!

### Solution

If anyone stumbles on this post or the Reddit thread you aren't crazy, sometime in 2022 Corsair changed the AM4 mounting bracket from the 2 hook to 4 screws on standoffs. 
If during the assembly you see the play between the back plate this is normal, everything tightens up nice when you screw down the thumb screws.
Also it helps if you have someone help by pushing the plate to help you screw it the thumb screws on the other side.
